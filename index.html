    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I'm a recent graduate from the University of Texas at Dallas with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I've worked at various companies such as Cognizant, Charles Schwab, and Toyota Financial Services as a Software Engineer. My main proficiency is
        in full-stack development, leveraging tools like Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I have displayed my work in various project displayed on my personal portfolio and GitHub for the world to see! I'm hoping to join a company that values individual
        creativity and development so I could further my technical career.
